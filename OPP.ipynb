        "**Theoretical Python OOP Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data (objects) rather than functions and logic. It focuses on binding data and the functions that operate on that data into a single unit (the class).\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data/variables) and methods (functions/behaviors) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has a state (defined by its attributes) and a behavior (defined by its methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object to the user. What an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (the class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. How the data and methods are bundled and protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Dunder methods, short for Double Underscore methods (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__), are special methods in Python that have two leading and two trailing underscores. They are also known as magic methods and allow you to define how custom objects interact with built-in operations and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child/derived class) is created from an existing class (parent/base class). The child class inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class, promoting code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It allows a single interface or method name to be used for different data types or classes. In Python, this is often achieved through method overriding and operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " --> Encapsulation is typically achieved in Python using naming     conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Single leading underscore (_variable): Suggests a \"protected\" attribute, meant for internal use, but still accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Double leading underscore (__variable): Triggers name mangling, making the attribute harder (though not impossible) to access directly from outside the class, acting as a form of \"private\" attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-->  The constructor in Python is the special method named __init__. It is automatically called when a new object (instance) of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the attributes of the newly created object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods (@classmethod): Methods that are bound to the class and receive the class itself as the first argument (conventionally named cls). They can modify the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods (@staticmethod): Methods that are associated with the class but do not operate on the instance or the class. They are essentially regular functions logically grouped within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Method overloading is the ability to define two or more methods within the same class that have the same name but different parameters (number or type). Python does not natively support traditional method overloading based on signature, but you can simulate it using default arguments or by checking the type/number of arguments inside a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This is a key mechanism for achieving polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The @property decorator is used to give a method the behavior of an attribute. It allows you to define getters, setters, and deleters for an attribute, enabling controlled access to class instance data while making it look like a direct attribute access to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Polymorphism is important because it allows for more flexible and generic code. It enables programmers to write consistent code that can work with objects of different types that share a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15)  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " --> An abstract class is a class that contains one or more abstract methods (methods declared but without an implementation). You cannot create an object (instance) of an abstract class. In Python, abstract classes are typically created by inheriting from the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module and using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        " 16)  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " -->\n",
        "\n",
        "  Reusability:\n",
        "  OOP promotes code reuse through inheritance. A new class (child class) can inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (parent class), meaning you don't have to write the same code multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Maintainability:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Code built with OOP principles is typically easier to manage, update, and fix. Problems are often localized to specific objects or classes, making debugging and modification simpler.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Security (Data Protection):\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Encapsulation protects data by bundling it with the methods that operate on it and restricting direct access. This prevents accidental or unauthorized modification of data from outside the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. This means you can write generic code that can work with various object types, making the system easier to extend without modifying existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  Easier Troubleshooting:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Because the structure of an OOP program mirrors real-world entities, and problems are often localized to specific objects, it becomes easier to identify and fix errors (debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        " 17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        " --> Class Variables are shared among all instances of class.         They  are defined outside the methods, usually right after the class header.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are typically defined and initialized inside the __init__ constructor using self..\n",
        "\n",
        "18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit      attributes and methods from more than one parent class. Python supports multiple inheritance, and the Method Resolution Order (MRO) rule (often following C3 linearization) determines the order in which base classes are searched for methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "19) Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  --> Both are used to represent the object as a string:\n",
        "  __str__: Used for creating a readable, end-user-friendly string representation of an object (e.g., what you want printed). Called by print() and str().\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__: Used for creating an unambiguous, developer-friendly string representation of an object. The goal is a string that, if passed to eval(), would recreate the object. Called by repr().\n",
        "\n",
        "20) What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The super() function provides a way to call a method from a parent or sibling class. Its most common use is within the child class's __init__ method to call the parent's __init__, ensuring the parent's attributes are correctly initialized.\n",
        "\n",
        "21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is called when an object is about to be destroyed or its reference count reaches zero. It is primarily used for cleanup activities like closing files or releasing external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        " --> With inheritance, polymorphism is achieved primarily through method overriding. When a method is called on an object, Python checks the object's class for the method. If found, it executes. If the object belongs to a derived class that has overridden a method from the base class, the derived class's version is executed, allowing objects of different classes to respond differently to the same method call.\n",
        "\n",
        "23) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (return self) after performing its operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "24) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be treated and invoked as a function. When an object is called like object_name(), the __call__ method is automatically executed."
